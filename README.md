# HM Juicer

Integrates with Juicer API for social feeds and allows accessible display of social media content.

## Installation

### Step 1
Install the plugin via `composer`. (Note, composer integration not implemented yet, so this won't work.  TODO: Update this and remove this note üòÖ.)

```bash
composer require humanmade/hm-juicer
```

### Step 2
Add the Juicer feed name to the `wp-config.php` file via the `JUICER_ID` constant.

```php
const JUICER_ID = 'myaccountname';
```

Alternately, if no `JUICER_ID` is set, the feed name can be set via a settings page that appears if this constant does not exist.

Here's a quick summary:

* Assign issues you're working on to yourself.
* Work on a branch per issue, something like `name-of-feature`. One branch per feature/bug, please.
* File a PR early so it can be used for tracking progress.
* When you're finished, mark the PR for review by labelling with "Reviewer Needed".
* Get someone to review your code, and assign to them; if no one is around, the project lead can review.
