# HM Juicer Templates

Two templates are bundled with the plugin.

See `'juicer_filter_feed_template'` for creating your own feed template file with a different naming structure.

See `'juicer_filter_template_dir_path'` for changing the template directory path.

See `'juicer_filter_template_prefix'` for changing the template part prefix from `part-juicer-`.

## `part-juicer-feed.php`
Handles the Juicer Loop and load more button (if one is requested);

## `part-juicer-post.php`
Handles the individual Juicer post item.
